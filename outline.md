# Designing a Simple Printed Circuit Board

## Introduction to Printed Circuit Boards

### What is a Printed Circuit Board?
- Definition
- Example applications
- Comparison and benefits over breadboards/perfboards

### Types of PCBs
- Layer count
- Substrate
- Structure

### Relevance to Circuits II
- Real-world implementation of theory
- Hands-on skills

## Design Workflow
- Circuit requirements
- Schematic capture
- Layout
- Manufacturing and Assembly

## Step-by-Step Guide for Simple Op-amp Circuit
- Design
    - Hand sketch
- Schematic capture
    - ERC
- Layout
    - Best practices   
    - DRC
- Exporting for fabrication

## Further Best Practices
- When to care
    - Frequencies, current, impedance, etc
- Routing
- Ground planes and decoupling
- Layers
